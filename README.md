# Weather-Station
This IoT weather station uses an ESP8266 and DHT11 sensor to monitor temperature and humidity. Data is sent via WiFi to the Blynk platform, where users can view real-time readings remotely. The Arduino IDE-based code ensures continuous data updates every two seconds for convenient and efficient environmental monitoring.
